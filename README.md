#  Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard - 2024

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) adoption across U.S. states, manufacturers, and consumer segments using VIN registration data. An interactive Excel dashboard provides insights into electric range, EV types, geographic trends, and clean fuel eligibility to support data-driven decision-making.

##  Objectives
- Identify states with the highest EV adoption.
- Compare Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
- Analyze average electric range by model and manufacturer.
- Explore Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.
- Discover top EV manufacturers and best-selling models.
- Track EV trends over model years and regions.
- Provide visual KPIs and dashboards for stakeholders.

##  Dataset Description
The project uses EV registration data with the following key columns:

| Column Name                          | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `VIN (1â€“10)`                        | Unique Vehicle Identifier |
| `County`, `City`, `State`, `Zip`   | Geographical info |
| `Model Year`                        | Year of manufacture |
| `Make`, `Model`                     | Manufacturer and model |
| `Electric Vehicle Type`            | BEV or PHEV |
| `CAFV Eligibility`                 | Clean fuel compliance status |
| `Electric Range`                   | Max miles on full charge |
| `Base MSRP`                        | Manufacturer suggested price |
| `Electric Utility`                 | Utility provider |
| `Vehicle Location`                 | Geo-coordinates |
| `Census Tract`                     | Demographic location data |

##  Data Preparation
- Converted raw data into structured Excel tables for easier referencing.
- Cleaned and standardized column formats.
- Used `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGEIFS`, and `INDEX-MATCH` for calculations.
- Built PivotTables and PivotCharts to summarize and filter data.
- Created slicers for interactive dashboard navigation.
